Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).

Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!

Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.

Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action.
However, make each class define the action differently.
